# webproject

Within the scope of the Bilge Adam Yetiştirme Programı Python Eğitimi, I made a small application about product tracking and management in this web project. 
I used Python's Django Web Development Framework during the project development stages.
I used MySQL as database and got help from Bootstrap css library for styles.
